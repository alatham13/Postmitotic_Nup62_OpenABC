### This directory contains the inputs for running training monomer simulations of various Nups.
All examples were performed with a scaling constant of 1.05, which was the optimal value.

To start simulations:
- python run_sim.py

To continue unfinished simulations:
- python run_restart.py

To analyze simulations (XXX.pdb is the CA pdb file, generated by run_sim.py):
- python ../../analysis/code/process_MOFF.py XXX.pdb

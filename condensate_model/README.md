### This directory contains the necessary code and input information to run and analyze simulations of FG-Nup condensates. The data is divided into 3 directories:

1. Training - simulations on 5 FG-Nup monomers, which are used to perform a 1-parameter optimization of the force field.
2. Slab simulations - slab simulations of FG-Nups to measure their propensity to undergo phase separation.
3. Surface_tension - simulations of FG-Nups in a constant volume box. Used to estimate the size and surface tension of condensates at NPC-specific copy numbers.

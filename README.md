A model of Nup62 phase separation used to rationalize the force exerted by the Nup62 complex during assembly. This code is broken down into 2 folders:
1. openabc2 - a modified version of openabc, enabling scaled versions of the MOFF potential
2. condensate_model - the simulations used to analyze Nup phase separation
